Moto -> Current Position, acceleration, and point for FoV
FoV -> Takes in nearby objects (when not in simulation, FoV object buffer is used to store the identifed obj from the object classifier)

# Calculations
- [ ] Acceleration estimation in range of both the up-coming path, nearby cars, up-coming cars, children, animals, nearby speed limit, and current acceleration
- [ ] Loading Traffic data based on GPA, maybe see if we can dynamically update traffic when obtaining stuff, but not useful for the sim

# Brain dump
- traffic lights
- acceleration
